This class comes into play in the interpolation step where each env.property is projected to the region.cells, using interpolation algorithm. For performance, it&#39;s imperative that access to each time&#45;series value is efficient, and repeated calls should have very low cost (implies possible caching) " alt="" coords="5,5,164,61"/>
